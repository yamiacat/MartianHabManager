Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings.

MVP

The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

Project Extensions

Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.
Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left.
View the total income for the zoo.
Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
